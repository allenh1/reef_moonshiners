# Reef Moonshiners

![Reef Moonshiner Logo](resource/icon.png)

## Intro

This is an implementation of Andre Mueller's [Reef Moonshiner](https://www.reefmoonshiners.com/)
program for reef care.

## Status

This is a work in progress, but there is an Android app, and it builds and runs for desktop platforms
(i.e. Linux, Windows, Mac OS X).

You can access the latest APK [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dPI3D31AlsigioxijnVDPVhWPmyRAMHG/view?usp=sharing). This APK is not guaranteed to be stable, but should be functional :).

As it is today, one can import an ICP test from ATI, and view their daily dosing schedule for
corrections and daily elements.

One can also adjust the tank size to reflect their system, and check / uncheck the refugium setting
(which doubles the dosage for daily elements).

**Note**: the "About" page does not show yet.
